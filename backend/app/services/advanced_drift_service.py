import difflib
"""Configuration Drift Detection Service.

Detects when a device's live running configuration has diverged from a
baseline -- its own last-known-good Scan
(DriftBaseline.PREVIOUS_BACKUP), an explicitly approved per-device
GoldenConfig (DriftBaseline.GOLDEN_CONFIG), or the shared compliance
template for its role (DriftBaseline.ROLE_BASELINE, via
ComplianceBaseline + Device.device_role -- a core switch and an access
switch shouldn't be judged against the same baseline just because
nobody's set a per-device GoldenConfig for either of them) -- and
records the result as a ConfigDrift row.

Reuses existing building blocks rather than duplicating them:
  - app.services.collectors.registry.get_collector for the live config read
    (same collector/credential-resolution path as routers/devices.py's
    /collect and /scan endpoints -- RULE 11: no second collection
    implementation)
  - difflib.unified_diff for the diff, app.services.risk_engine for risk
    scoring of the drifted config (the same weighted rule set used to
    score a proposed change is used here to score how risky the *drifted*
    config is)
  - app.services.audit_service for the same audit-trail visibility every
    other action gets, app.services.alert_service for HIGH/CRITICAL drift
    alerts

Called by:
  - app.api.drift (on-demand scan, GET .../drift/scan)
  - app.tasks.drift_detection_task (nightly per-device Celery task, see
    celery beat schedule in app.celery_app)
